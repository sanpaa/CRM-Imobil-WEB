# Supabase Storage Configuration
# ======================
# REQUIRED FOR IMAGE UPLOADS - Without this, uploads will fail!
# 
# After getting your Supabase credentials above, you MUST create a storage bucket:
# 
# Quick Setup:
#   Run: npm run storage:setup
#   This will check if the bucket exists and guide you through creation
# 
# Manual Setup:
#   1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
#   2. Navigate to Storage → Buckets
#   3. Click "New Bucket"
#   4. Name: property-images (EXACT name required!)
#   5. ✅ CHECK "Public bucket" - This is CRITICAL!
#   6. Click "Create bucket"
# 
# Troubleshooting:
#   - Error "Bucket not found": The bucket doesn't exist yet
#   - Error "Upload failed": The bucket might not be public
#   - See STORAGE_SETUP.md for detailed help
# 
# Verify everything is configured:
#   Run: npm run verify

# Geocoding Configuration (Optional)
# ======================
# For improved geocoding reliability, you can configure a Google Maps API key

# 
# How to get a Google Maps API key:
#   1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
#   2. Create a project or select existing one
#   3. Enable "Geocoding API"
#   4. Create credentials (API Key)
#   5. Restrict the API key to Geocoding API only (recommended)
